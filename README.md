## ✍️ Features 

- A fully `responsive` website adapts its interface to tablet and phone views.
- Project deployed to `Azure Web App` with `Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server`
- Features a user registration and login system with access control, creating posts, updating posts, deleting posts, adding users, updating users, deleting users, creating categories, updating categories, and deleting categories.
-`Admin` can do all the above, but `Authur` can only add posts and manage his own posts
- When we delete a category, an uncategorized category will automatically add. Those posts that belong to the deleted category will become uncategorized.
- When we signup or create a user, we need to fill all the inputs with 8 or more characters for the password
- When we delete a user, all posts belonging to that user will be deleted automatically. This feature is realized by `foreign key` through MySQL.
